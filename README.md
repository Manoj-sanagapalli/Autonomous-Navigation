# Autonomous-Navigation
Autonomous navigation of mobile robot using 3D map created from Kinect camera in ROS architecture.
Created as part of student project by Manoj Sanagapalli

1. Robotics lab is mapped using manual control of mobile robot using kinect camera.
2. After getting a 3-D map, the robot is localized itself in the process using SLAM packages of ROS.
3. using navigation packages of ROS, robot is navigated autonomously to a given goal.


Please refer quick summary to understand the project as a jist.
